The objective of this project is to develop a shell script-based application for managing student records within the ALU registration system. The application, implemented in a series of shell scripts, provides users with a range of functionalities to create, save, view, delete, and update student records. Additionally, it enables users to extract and store a specific set of student information - email addresses - in a separate file. This project aims to streamline the administrative process of student data management and offer automation for moving and backing up project-related files. make this paragraph shorter
